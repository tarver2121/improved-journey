//This is a program that mimics a shopping list 
//Through doing this i have learned more about vectors

int main()
{
    string n,a;
    vector<string> shopping_list;
    int i;
    
    cout << " hello user add items to a shopping lise. Type end when you are done" << endl;
    while(a != "end")
    {  cout << " add an item to the shopping cart" << endl;
        cout << " add *** to the front and back of your favorite item " << endl;
        cin >> n;
        shopping_list.push_back(n);
        cout << " do you want to end this program? type end if so " << endl;
        cin >> a;
    }
    
    if(a == "end")
        for(i = 0; i < shopping_list.size(); i++)
            cout << shopping_list[i] << " ";
